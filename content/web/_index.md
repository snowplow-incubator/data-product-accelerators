Welcome to the **Advanced Analytics for Web** accelerator. Once finished, you will be able to build a deeper understanding of customer behaviour on your website and use your data to influence business decisions.

Here you will learn to:

* Model and Visualize Snowplow data
  - using the [snowplow-web](https://hub.getdbt.com/snowplow/snowplow_web/latest/) dbt package and Streamlit
  - using our sample data for Snowflake or Databricks (no need to have a working pipeline)
* Set-up Snowplow Tracking and Enrichment
* Apply what you have learned on your own pipeline to gain insights
***

#### Who is this guide for?

- Data practitioners who would like to get familiar with Snowplow data.
- Data practitioners who want to learn how to use the snowplow-web dbt package and set-up tracking using their companies website or single page application, to gain insight from their customersâ€™ behavioral data as quickly as possible.

***

#### What you will learn

In approximately 8 working hours you can achieve the following:

- **Upload data -** Upload a sample Snowplow events dataset to your warehouse
- **Model -** Configure and run the snowplow-web data model
- **Visualize -** Visualize the modeled data with Streamlit or Databricks notebook
- **Track -** Set-up and deploy tracking to your website or single page application
- **Enrich -** Add enrichments to your data
- **Next steps -** Gain value from your own pipeline data through modeling and visualization
